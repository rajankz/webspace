Easily display posts grouped by year and month, in one or more elegant formats

== Description ==

Smart Archives Reloaded allows you to display a list of posts grouped by year and month. It also provides several interesting navigation elements.

**Format list:**

* **list** = a list of posts grouped by month
* **block** = a compact block of links to year and date archive pages
* **menu** = a two-level menu with links to year and date archive pages
* **both** = block + list ([example](http://scribu.net/archive))
* **fancy** = menu + list + JavaScript ([example](http://www.conceptfusion.co.nz/archive))

**Credits:**

* [Justin Blanton](http://justinblanton.com), for the original [Smart Archives](http://justinblanton.com/projects/smartarchives/) plugin
* [Simon Pritchard](http://www.conceptfusion.co.nz/), for the fancy format

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Error on activation: "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected..." =

Make sure your host is running PHP 5. The only foolproof way to do this is to add this line to wp-config.php (after the opening `<?php` tag):

`var_dump(PHP_VERSION);`
<br>

= Fancy archive not working =

In footer.php in your theme directory, make sure you have this code somewhere:

`<?php wp_footer(); ?>`.

= How can I change the CSS or HTML? =
