== Description ==

**FeaturedArticles for WordPress** slideshow plugin allows you to create sliders in your blog pages directly from your already written content, be it posts or pages. With the ability to change any slider aspect by making use of slideshow themes that are delivered with the plugin, almost anything is possible. Also, it offers the possibility to create additional themes (with some PHP, CSS and JavaScript knowledge) that can have custom written animations by extending the base functionality of the main slider script.

Slideshows can be placed by one of these ways (or all at the same time):

* manual placement directly into your WordPress theme template files (requires editing the template file you want to place a slideshow in and add a small piece of code);
* shortcode placement directly into a post or page content;
* widget placement into any widget areas your theme has;
* automatic placement in any page just above the page loop.

While Lite version of FeaturedArticles provides all the neccessary tools for creating very nice slideshows, PRO version of this same plugin comes in addition with:

* 4 more themes developed by our developers team (7 in total, 3 video enabled by default in PRO version);
* **video enabled** custom slides for **YouTube and Vimeo** that can replace the image with a video ( [See examples here](http://www.codeflavors.com/featured-articles-pro/examples/ "FeaturedArticles PRO examples") );
* custom writen slides that can be written using the visual editor;
* slideshows can display custom post types if your WordPress blog has them;
* for posts and custom post types, selection of posts by taxonomies;
* mixing of posts, custom posts, pages and custom slides into the same slideshow;
* visual color scheme editor that allows you to blend-in slideshows into your overall blog design without having to write a single line of CSS;
* priority support and debugging for 3'rd party plugins and themes conflicts.

**Features:**

* Add, remove, order any slideshow content made of pages or mixed content;
* Animation control (based on individual themes);
* Write custom slides by using the WordPress editor (PRO);
* Put videos in custom slides from Vimeo or YouTube to replace the image for both thumbnails and full background image - compatible with both Flash players and HTML5 players from Vimeo and YouTube(PRO);
* Customize posts and pages displayed into slideshows by specifying a different title, content, slide background color, image and more;
* Change themes by choosing from up to 7 currently available themes (only 3 in Lite version);
* Change theme color palette by simply creating a new color stylesheet that can skin the theme without messing with the CSS responsible for layout;
* Create color palette stylesheets using a visual editor(PRO);
* Preview slideshow even before publishing it in your pages.
* Display slideshows by widgets, shorcodes, manual code snippet or automatic display above any page loop;
* Create new themes that can completely change the default animations and can add new options fields custom for it in Slider editing in WordPress admin.

These are just a few of the things this plugin can do so just go on and try it for yourself.

What can this plugin be used for? Well, you name it and we'll find a way to make it happen. Guaranteed! 

== Installation ==

**Before updating, make sure you back-up all your custom made themes.**

With version 2.4, things went a little different. We tried (you judge) to make an easier, funnier and more extensible way of creating themes for FeaturedArticles slideshows. Themes prior to this version should still work.
Also, starting with this version we moved the plugin to a different website called [CodeFlavors](http://www.codeflavors.com/ "CodeFlavors - devoted to WordPress"). This will be the home of all plugins we are going to develop for WordPress from now on.
If you find yourself into trouble with this update, we have docs, community forums and we'll be happy to help you.

**You'll notice something missing!**. Automatic placement is no longer displayed into slideshow settings by default. To enable it, go to Settings and check the *Enable automatic slider insertion* option.
Why we did this? Well, starting with next version (after 2.4), this automatic placement will become much, much better. We have some ideas, we just need to figure out some things first and if we would have done this with this update, it would have taken too long.

Now, here are the update instructions (automatic update will also work):

If you are upgrading to the current version, make sure you backup all the files of the previous installation. After you backup, go to wp-admin and disable the plugin. With a FTP client, delete the plugin completely.

1. Disable the previous installation of Featured Articles Lite
2. FTP to plugins directory of your blog and delete the plugin. 
1. Download and extract folder featured-articles-lite
2. Upload the whole *featured-articles-lite* folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to WP Admin->FA Lite->Edit/Add and configure your first slider
5. To display the slider, you can either choose sections from admin ( homepage, pages or categories ), display the newly created slider as a widget, use shortcodes in post or pages or place the following code in your template: 

`<?php FA_display_slider(YOUR SLIDER ID HERE); ?>`

For your convenience, once you save a slider, under Manual Placement you will see the code needed to be placed into your theme files to display it.

`<?php echo FA_truncate_text($post->post_content, $image ? $options['desc_truncate'] : $options['desc_truncate_noimg']);?>`

* Easy setting for featured posts and pages to be displayed into the slider
* Image detection improved even more. Currently there are 2 ways to set an image for a certain post: by setting the image as a custom field and second by detecting the image from post content. For images detected in post content, the plugin tries to identify the exact attachment from the database and if found, it automatically sets the image into the custom field. The only thing it needs is for the image to have the width and height attributes set in HTML.
* New theme available (Smoke). See screenshots for details and [WP featured articles Lite homepage](http://www.php-help.ro/mootools-12-javascript-examples/wordpress-featured-content-plugin/#additional-themes "WP Featured Articles plugin - theme Smoke settings") for instructions on how to set up this theme.

* Links in featured posts text allowed 
* For automatic placement, option to choose loop to display on top of

Initial release for the new redesigned Wordpress Featured Articles

== Troubleshooting ==

Plugin is guaranteed to work on a clean Wordpress install. Since themes and other plugins don't always play nice, there are a few things you could check if slideshows won't work in your pages:

1. Check that only one jquery file is loaded. Most times, a manually loaded jQuery version in theme header or by a plugin may be the cause. Look in your page source in browser and see if that's the problem.
2. Plugins merging JavaScript and CSS files may also cause problems. In this case, it's all about god intentions with bad results.
3. Use the proper Wordpress version (3.1 +).
4. See if your theme footer.php file calls wp_footer().

If all options are exhausted, you can always ask for help on our forums. We'll answer whenever the time allows us to.

ONLY FOR VERSIONS PRIOR TO 2.3

The slider script is developed using MooTools 1.2. Since the framework isn't bundled in Wordpress (as jQuery is), the plugin adds the MooTools framework along with the other scripts it needs to run into the blog header. If other plugins running on MooTools are installed the page will issue Javascript errors. To solve this problem, in slider administration page there's an option to drop the MooTools script so that conflicts no longer occur.

Another known problem is if any of the plugin installed use Prototype framework. MooTools and Prototype are conflicting and the only solution would be to remove one of the plugins (either the MooTools based or the Prototype based plugins).

Usually, after you install Featured Articles Lite into your blog and you go see it in front-end and the slider doesn't work it's a clear sign that there's a framework conflict. First thing to to is to go to wp-admin and open the FA Lite settings panel. Look for option Unload MooTools framework and uncheck it. Go back to front-end and see if the slider works. If it does, this means that another plugin uses MooTools and there was a conflict because MooTools was included twice in header.
If the slider still doesn't work, look into page source and do a search for "prototype.js". If you can see it in your page source it's time to make a decision: use FA Lite and deactivate the plugin using Prototype or drop FA Lite and continue using the other plugin.
